## The Confession

I have a problem. I start side projects like other people start Netflix series - with great enthusiasm and terrible follow-through.

My GitHub is a graveyard of half-finished ideas, each one representing a weekend of excitement followed by months of neglect.

Let me give you the tour.

## The Hall of Abandoned Dreams

### TaskMaster Pro (2019)
**The Idea:** A todo app that would revolutionize productivity by using AI to prioritize tasks.

**What I Built:** A basic CRUD app with a fancy gradient background.

**Why It Died:** Turns out building AI is hard. Also, the world doesn't need another todo app.

**What I Learned:** Validate the problem before building the solution.

### CoffeeTracker (2020)
**The Idea:** Track your coffee consumption and find the perfect brewing ratios.

**What I Built:** A React app that could log coffee drinks and show pretty charts.

**Why It Died:** I realized I was the only person obsessive enough about coffee data to use this.

**What I Learned:** Build for a market, not just for yourself.

### DevMemes (2021)
**The Idea:** A meme generator specifically for programming jokes.

**What I Built:** A working meme generator with templates and text overlay.

**Why It Died:** Memes are hard to monetize, and I got bored after the initial novelty wore off.

**What I Learned:** Passion projects need sustainable motivation, not just initial excitement.

### LocalEats (2022)
**The Idea:** A platform to help people discover local restaurants through community recommendations.

**What I Built:** User authentication, restaurant listings, and a review system.

**Why It Died:** Marketing is harder than coding. I built it, but nobody came.

**What I Learned:** "If you build it, they will come" is a lie.

### FocusFlow (2023)
**The Idea:** A Pomodoro timer that adapts to your energy levels throughout the day.

**What I Built:** A beautiful timer with statistics and customizable intervals.

**Why It Died:** I kept tweaking the algorithm instead of shipping. Perfect became the enemy of good.

**What I Learned:** Ship early, iterate based on feedback.

## The Pattern Recognition

Looking back, I see the same patterns in every failure:

### The Shiny Object Syndrome
I'd get excited about a new technology and build a project just to try it out. The tech was the goal, not the product.

### The Feature Creep
Every project started simple but grew complex as I added "just one more feature" before launching.

### The Solo Act
I tried to do everything myself - design, development, marketing, business development. Turns out I'm not good at all of those things.

### The Perfectionist Trap
I'd spend weeks polishing features that nobody would ever use instead of getting feedback from real users.

## The Survivors

Not everything died. A few projects made it past the initial enthusiasm:

### This Blog
**Why It Survived:** I kept it simple. No complex features, no grand monetization plans. Just writing.

### My Dotfiles Repo
**Why It Survived:** I use it every day. Selfish motivation is powerful motivation.

### A Simple Expense Tracker
**Why It Survived:** I built it for my wife, got immediate feedback, and kept it focused on solving one problem well.

## What I'm Doing Differently Now

### Start with the Problem
I now spend more time talking to potential users before writing any code. What problem are they actually facing? How are they solving it now?

### Embrace Constraints
I give myself artificial limits: 
- One weekend to build an MVP
- No more than 3 core features
- Must be useful to at least 10 people I know personally

### Ship Ugly
My first versions are embarrassingly basic. But they work, and they get feedback.

### Find Accountability
I tell people about my projects now. Public commitment is powerful motivation.

## The Graveyard's Gift

Every failed project taught me something:
- How to use new technologies
- What users actually want (vs. what I think they want)
- The importance of marketing and distribution
- When to pivot and when to persist

The graveyard isn't a monument to failure - it's a library of lessons.

## Current Project: Still Breathing

I'm working on a simple tool to help developers track their learning goals. It's basic, it's ugly, and I've already shown it to 5 people who said they'd use it.

Will it join the graveyard? Maybe. But if it does, I'll learn something new to add to the collection.

## Your Graveyard

What's in your side project graveyard? What patterns do you see in your abandoned ideas?

Share your failures - they're often more instructive than successes.

And remember: the graveyard isn't the end of the story. It's just the beginning of wisdom.

*Here lies another brilliant idea, poorly executed. May it rest in peace and rise as knowledge.*
