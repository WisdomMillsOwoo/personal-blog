## An Introduction
Hi, My name Wisdom and after 10 years of being a software developer, I finally decided to build my own site, starting with this blog

You can read a bit more about me in the [about page](/about).

## Why A Website

Mostly to have somewhere to share some future projects, but also just to prove to myself that I can build, maintain, and learn from doing it.

## Why A Blog

I think of the blog as a way to give back a bit. I've learned so much from the internet in my career, 
but I've never published anything to help others. I used to think maybe I shouldn't because there is always 
someone that knows more than me, but I'm learning that I should anyway because:

- 1. There are never enough perspectives on building good software
- 2. Representation is important, and I like to see black engineers post more, so I should be the future that I want.
- 3. I legitimately think I will enjoy it, and also learn a lot from it.
- 4. I feel like the WEB is making a real comeback!

## What To Expect

Posts about software, music, tech, and life in general. I want to write about things that I find interesting, 
honestly, that could be anything.

## Message To the World

Build your own website! It's cool and it's not that hard I promise! 

If I can do it, you can too!

Thanks for reading!
