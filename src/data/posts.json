I've learned so much from the internet in my career,<br>\nbut I've never published anything to help others. I used to think maybe I shouldn't because there is always<br>\nsomeone that knows more than me, but I'm learning that I should anyway because:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><ol>\n<li>There are never enough perspectives on building good software</li>\n</ol></li>\n<li><ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Representation is important, and I like to see black engineers post more, so I should be the future that I want.</li>\n</ol></li>\n<li><ol start=\"3\">\n<li>I legitimately think I will enjoy it, and also learn a lot from it.</li>\n</ol></li>\n<li><ol start=\"4\">\n<li>I feel like the WEB is making a real comeback!</li>\n</ol></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What To Expect</h2>\n<p>Posts about software, music, tech, and life in general. I want to write about things that I find interesting,<br>\nhonestly, that could be anything.</p>\n<h2>Message To the World</h2>\n<p>Build your own website! It's cool and it's not that hard I promise!</p>\n<p>If I can do it, you can too!</p>\n<p>Thanks for reading!</p>\n",
