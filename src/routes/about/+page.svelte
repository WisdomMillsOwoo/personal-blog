  <h1>About</h1>
  <p>My name is Wisdom Mills-Owoo, I'm a so-so software engineer living in the US</p>
  <p>
    I have many interests and I never know which of them to focus on. I used to spend
    quite a bit of energy trying force myself to focus on one thing, but I find that I'm
    much happier when I just let my self spiral from one thing to the other. :)

    This is my personal blog, where I may be writing about random topics that cross my mind.
    Or, I may abandon this immediately after I publish it. In fact, I may not even end
    up deploying this code, and you might just be reading this on github. (If I even en up
    committing it.)
  </p>
  <p>
    I would like to give credit to <a href="https://github.com/K-Sato1995">K-Sato1995</a> for the svelte template I used
    to build the initial version of this blog.
  </p>
  <p>
    As always, I also give thanks to God. üôèüèø
